        Hello, my name is Farid and for the past 6 years I have been focusing on creating better product experiences for people because it brings me joy.
        <br>
        <br>
        But I'm interested in the many facets of design: Architecture, Interior Design, Industrial Design, Fashion, You name it. I'm drawn to thoughtful, long lasting design and strive to make the world an even more pleasant place to be.

    <h3>Last Call: Notes about this portfolio</h3>
    <p class="desc">
        So the entire goal of this portfolio was to create a visual container for my favorite, most sentimental work that doesn’t take away any attention from the actual content of the case studies and lets the reader focus on my writing. I wanted to do something that I would be able to entirely build on my own with HTML, CSS, and some JS. The process and code are available in the GitHub link in the footer. The visuals are a throwback to bare-bones, minimalistic POST screens on older computers, and the entire navigation is based on the F-keys. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the future, I think an operating-system-themed portfolio would be cool, where you start on the desktop and my projects are saved as files that are clickable. There would be a folder with a collection of design items that I enjoy and that inspire me, which I would update on a regular basis. I could build a lot of soul and even Easter eggs into it, like Solitaire or Minesweeper. It would continue the computer theme, add more depth, and feel more polished.
